    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Ah, seeker... you’ve stumbled into the void.</p>

    <p>The page you’re looking for is an illusion, a mirage shimmering on the horizon of the web.
       Just as a bowl is most useful when empty, this emptiness is here to remind you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The ego clings to certainty, but enlightenment embraces the unknown.</li>
      <li>To lose your way is sometimes the surest way to find the Path.</li>
      <li>What you seek may not exist here—but perhaps what you truly seek is beyond pages and words.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Return now, traveler, and sip again from the waters of wisdom.</p>

    <p>
      <a class="md-button md-button--primary" href="{{ base_url }}/">Go home</a>
      <a class="md-button" href="{{ base_url }}/search/">Search the site</a>
    </p>
