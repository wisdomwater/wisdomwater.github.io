# 404 — Page Not Found  

Ah, seeker... you’ve stumbled into the void.  

The page you’re looking for is an illusion, a mirage shimmering on the horizon of the web.  
Just as a bowl is most useful when empty, this emptiness is here to remind you:  

- The ego clings to certainty, but enlightenment embraces the unknown.  
- To lose your way is sometimes the surest way to find the Path.  
- What you seek may not exist here—but perhaps what you truly seek is beyond pages and words.  

Return now, traveler, and sip again from the waters of wisdom.
